# 🌲 Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud ☁️

This is a sample project used to learn Cypress from the course I'm doing from [Talking About Testing School](https://udemy.com/user/walmyr)

## Pre-requirements
Before starting, ensure that the following systems are installed on your computer.

> I used versions `v2.34.1`, `v18.15.0`, and `v9.5.0` of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

## Installation

After cloning the repository and accessing it, run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
In this project you have got two options, you can run tests in both headless and interactive modes.

### Headless mode
Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode in a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run test:mobile` to run the tests in headless mode in a mobile viewport.

### Interactive mode
Run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App and run the tests in interactive mode in a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open:mobiletest` to run the tests in interactive mode in a mobile viewport.
